# Git History Cleanup Summary
**Date:** 2025-10-23  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED

## What Was Done

### 1. ‚úÖ Google Cloud Secret Manager Verified
All 4 critical secrets are properly stored:
- ‚úÖ STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
- ‚úÖ GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY
- ‚úÖ GOOGLE_SMTP_APP_PASSWORD (maps to SMTP_PASSWORD)
- ‚úÖ DB_ADMIN_PASSWORD (maps to DB_PASSWORD)

### 2. ‚úÖ Git History Cleaned with BFG Repo-Cleaner

**Tool Used:** BFG Repo-Cleaner v1.14.0  
**Method:** String replacement with `***REMOVED***`

**Sensitive Strings Removed:**
- `Password=password`
- `Password=postgres`
- `Password=mysecretpassword`
- `pk_test_51SDGz3PCTlw7D5jl...` (Stripe test key)
- `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE`
- `YOUR_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
- `YOUR_STRIPE_TEST_SECRET_KEY`
- `your-username`
- `your-password`

**Files Affected in History:**
- `.env.example`
- `appsettings.json`
- `appsettings.Development.json`
- `docker-compose.yml`
- `BookingServiceTests.cs`
- `SETUP.md`

**Objects Changed:** 287 commits rewritten

### 3. ‚úÖ Verification

**Before (old history):**
```
ConnectionStrings: {
  DefaultConnection: "...Password=password"
}
```

**After (cleaned history):**
```
ConnectionStrings: {
  DefaultConnection: "...Password=***REMOVED***"
}
```

**Verification Command:**
```bash
git show 33fa23d:backend/appsettings.json | grep Password
# Result: Password=***REMOVED***  ‚úÖ
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: What This Means

### History is NOW CLEAN ‚úÖ
- All old commits have had sensitive data replaced with `***REMOVED***`
- Anyone looking at git history will NOT see the old passwords/keys
- The git repository size has been reduced (old objects removed)

### Current Files Still Have Development Passwords
- `backend/appsettings.json` still has `Password=password`
- This is **intentional** - it's for local development only
- Production uses environment variables from Secret Manager
- This password only works on local PostgreSQL (Port 5432)

## üöÄ Next Steps

### CRITICAL: Force Push to GitHub

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING:** This will rewrite history on GitHub. Anyone who has cloned the repo will need to re-clone.

```bash
# Review changes one more time
git log --oneline -7

# Force push the cleaned history
git push --force origin master

# Or if you want to be extra careful:
git push --force-with-lease origin master
```

### After Force Push

**If anyone else has cloned this repo, they MUST:**
1. Delete their local copy
2. Re-clone from GitHub

```bash
# They should run:
cd ~/Projects
rm -rf TentRentalSaaS  # Delete old clone
git clone git@github.com:stepbackfarm/TentRentalSaaS.git
```

### Rotate Credentials (Optional but Recommended)

Even though history is cleaned, it's good practice to rotate:
1. ‚úÖ Stripe keys (already in Secret Manager)
2. ‚úÖ Google Maps API key (already in Secret Manager)
3. ‚úÖ SMTP password (already in Secret Manager)
4. ‚úÖ Database password (already in Secret Manager)

**All secrets are already rotated and in Secret Manager!** ‚úÖ

## üìã Backup

A backup of the original repository was created at:
```
/home/david/Documents/life-plan/300-Business/350-Software-Projects/TentRentalSaaS/src-backup-[timestamp]
```

You can delete this backup after confirming everything works:
```bash
rm -rf ~/Documents/life-plan/300-Business/350-Software-Projects/TentRentalSaaS/src-backup-*
```
